# Final Project

## Objective 

Please submit a few sentences proposing what you would like to do for your final project.

## Site title: "laundrypaid.com"

## Site description:

My website's primary focus will be to preview my upcoming laundry payments app for classical coin operated laundromats in both apartment buildings and in brick and mortar locations. I would like to model a similar page design and flow to: http://polishdapp.com/index.html which is listed on General Assembly's website. I want to create a landing page for a new mobile app concept I have leveraging domains I purchased as either "laundrypaid.com" or "laundrypay.com". As this app is under serious consideration to be developed as an MVP prototype with associated software and hardware I will aim to build this site to be mobile friendly. If time permits during the remaining semester, then I will provide more wireframe screen shots of the web prototype.
